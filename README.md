# Website-Blocker

A Udemy Project

This is an app which will help you to block all the websites which you don't want to open or get open by itself. Also, blocking some social networking sites during your office/working hours. It will run in the background of your system and won't let you open the sites, which will hamper your productivity. It is very small in size so you don't have to worry about system performance and can be used in day-to-day life.

This app is developed using python. This is an app made while developing my existing python skills through Udemy course.
